- [x] [Permutation sensitivity](/permutation-sensitivity.ipynb) is a model-agnostic way to assess the dependence of your model's predictions upon a small number of features in the dataset, by randomizing rows for specific columns and assessing the effect upon the output. It only makes sense for low dimensionality data, with a fixed number of features.
