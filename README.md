Examples of tools and algorithms I think are useful, with worked examples and notes. 

I add things here when I'm learning them or explaining them to somebody. I'm also infrequently working on more interactive explanations of core ML principles in [intuitive-ml](https://github.com/archydeberker/intuitive-ml).

You can run all of these notebooks via Binder, who kindly provide a hosted environment for running Jupyter notebooks [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/archydeberker/armoury/master)
